# EMP Generator for Drone Neutralization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a **prototype Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) generator** designed to **neutralize drones** by disrupting their electronic systems. EMP technology is a non-kinetic countermeasure that emits electromagnetic radiation to disable electronic devices within a specific range, making it useful for **defense, security, and anti-surveillance applications**.

## Features
✅ **EMP-based Drone Neutralization** – Disrupts UAV electronics to disable or force them to crash.  
✅ **Non-Kinetic Defense Mechanism** – Provides an alternative to traditional counter-drone measures.  
✅ **Portable & Prototype Build** – Designed as a small-scale prototype for research and testing.  

## Technical Specifications
- **EMP Pulse Generation**: Uses a capacitor-based pulse discharge mechanism.  
- **Power Source**: Standard AA batteries with a capacitor bank.  
- **Coil Design**: Copper wire wrapped around an iron core for electromagnetic discharge.  
- **Activation Mechanism**: Manually triggered pulse via a switch.  
- **Effective Range**: Short-range, optimized for close proximity electronic disruption.  

## How It Works
1. **Energy Storage** – A capacitor is charged to store electrical energy.  
2. **Pulse Generation** – When triggered, the stored energy is rapidly discharged through a coil.  
3. **EMP Emission** – The sudden discharge creates a **high-intensity electromagnetic pulse** that interferes with nearby electronics, particularly drones.  

## Applications
🚀 **Defense & Security** – Can be integrated into anti-drone defense systems.  
🚁 **Critical Infrastructure Protection** – Protects sensitive areas from unauthorized UAV surveillance.  
🔬 **Research & Development** – Used for studying EMP effects on electronics.  

## Limitations & Considerations
⚠️ **Limited Range** – Current prototype is effective only at close range.  
⚠️ **Potential Collateral Effects** – EMP may affect unintended electronic devices.  
⚠️ **Regulatory Concerns** – EMP technology is subject to government regulations; unauthorized use is restricted.  

## Future Improvements
- **Increased Power & Range** for wider-area drone neutralization.  
- **Shielding & Directional Control** to minimize collateral damage.  
- **Automated Targeting & Deployment System** for defense applications.
